For this challenge, we must:
    Select all columns using the all-column wildcard (*).
    Restrict the selected rows using the WHERE clause so that only records satisfying both of the following two conditions are returned:
        COUNTRYCODE is USA, meaning the cities are American.
        POPULATION is greater than 100000.

SELECT * 
FROM CITY 
WHERE 
    COUNTRYCODE = 'USA' 
    AND POPULATION > 100000;
